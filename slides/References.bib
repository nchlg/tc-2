	abstract = {{MPSoCs} have been proposed as a promising architecture choice to overcome the challenging embedded electronics requirements, characterized by tights development times and fast evolution of applications. The {MPSoC} flexibility, also represents a system vulnerability. As security requirements vary dramatically for different applications, the challenge is to provide {MPSoC} security that allows a trustworthy system that meets all the security requirements of such applications. {NoC} has become an attractive alternative to support the {MPSoC} communication requirements. Our work proposes the implementation of dynamic security architecture to overcome present {MPSoC} vulnerabilities. We integrate agile and dynamic security firewalls into the {NoC} in order to detect attacks based on different security rules. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach over several {MPSoCs} scenarios and estimate their impact on the overall performance. We show that our architecture can perform a fast detection of a wide range of attacks and a fast configuration of the different security policies for several {MPSoC} applications.},

	abstract = {On-chip network is often dynamically shared among applications that are concurrently running on a chip-multiprocessor ({CMP}). In general, such shared resources imply that applications can affect each other's timing characteristics through interference in shared resources. For example, in on-chip networks, multiple flows can compete for links and buffers. We show that this interference is an attack vector through which a malicious application may be able to infer data-dependent information about other applications (side channel attacks), or two applications can exchange information covertly when direct communications are prohibited (covert channel attacks). To prevent these timing channel attacks, we propose an efficient scheme which uses priority-based arbitration and a static limit mechanism to provide one-way information-leak protection. The proposed technique requires minimal changes to the router hardware. The simulation results show that the protection scheme effectively eliminates a timing channel from high-security to low-security domains with minimal performance overheads for realistic traffic patterns.},

In applications that present a large amount of packet exchanges the error is propagated, significantly affecting the mapping results. The paper proposes a high-level application model that captures the traffic effect, enabling to estimate the dynamic energy consumption. In order to evaluate the quality of the proposed model, a set of real and synthetic applications were described using both, a previously proposed model that does not capture the bit transition effect, and the model proposed here. Each highlevel application model was implemented inside a framework that enables the description of different applications and {NoC} topologies.

	abstract = {Next to performance, it becomes increasingly important that Networks-on-Chip ({NoCs}) also provide security features such as access control, authentication and availability. They are usually implemented by firewalls at the network interfaces ({NIs}) of the processing elements ({PEs}). This paper provides a more efficient way to integrate these security requirements into application-specific {NoCs} by inserting firewalls also between {NoC} routers. This approach helps to reduce the communication overhead required for the security information in the packet headers, which can consume 3\% to 9\% of the total communication bandwidth. It is challenging to manually find the optimal firewall configuration because an application-specific {NoC} has an irregular topology, which is customized for certain known application, e.g. a smartphone chip. Thus, we show how to automatically solve this problem by formulating it as an Integer Linear Programming ({ILP}) problem. The solution results in firewall positions such that the communication overhead is minimized and all given security requirements are satisfied. Experiments are performed on two industrial system specifications. Compared to the solution with the firewalls at the {NIs}, communication overhead is reduced by up to 63\%. The optimization only takes a few seconds for a standard {ILP} solver.},

Towards a secure system at each level of design, this paper addresses security aspects related to Network-on-Chip ({NoC}) architectures, foreseen as the communication infrastructure of next-generation embedded devices.

In this paper, we present a secure {NoC} architecture composed of a set of Data Protection Units ({DPUs}) implemented within the Network Interfaces ({NIs}){footnotePart} of this work is under patent pending. The run-time configuration of the programmable part of the {DPUs} is managed by a central unit, the Network Security Manager ({NSM}). The {DPU}, similar to a firewall, can check and limit the access rights (none, read, write, or both) of processors accessing data and instructions in a shared memory - in particular distinguishing between the operating roles (supervisor/user and secure/unsecure) of the processing elements. We explore different alternative implementations for the {DPU} and demonstrate how this unit does not affect the network latency if the memory request has the appropriate rights. We also focus on the dynamic updating of the {DPUs} to support their utilization in dynamic environments, and on the utilization of authentication techniques to increase the level of security.},

	abstract = {The topology, the routing algorithm and the way the traffic pattern is distributed over the network influence the ultimate performance of the interconnection network. Off-chip high-performance interconnects provide mechanisms to support irregular topologies, whereas in on-chip networks the topology is fixed at design time. Continuous trend on device miniaturization and high volume manufacturing increase the probability of faults in embedded systems, leading to irregular topologies. Also, partitionability and virtualization of the entire on-chip network is envisioned for future systems. These trends lead to the need of routing algorithms that adapt to the static or dynamic changes in irregular topologies.In this paper we analyze the benefits of the reconfiguration at the routing algorithm level in order to allow topology changes. That is, support topology changes that appear on the network due to different reasons including switch or link failures, energy reduction decisions or design and manufacturing issues. We perform an exhaustive analysis on the performance impact of the routing algorithm in a {NoC} system. Our aim is to enable the possibility of reconfiguration of the routing algorithm. We take advantage on the flexibility offered by the segment-based routing methodology that allows a fast computation of many deadlock-free routing algorithms by obtaining different segmentation processes and routing restriction policies. This study analyzes the potentials offered by {SR}. Results show that the election of the routing algorithm may greatly affect the final performance of the network. Additionally, we propose an organized segmentation process that achieves reliable performance with low variability for all topologies studied under uniform traffic conditions. These results encourages us to the search of a dynamic mechanism that adapts the routing algorithm to the traffic.},

	abstract = {In the future almost every consumer electronics device will be connected to an ecosystem of third-party partners providing services such as payment, streaming content, and so on. Present work aims to expose the foundations of a secure environment by ensuring security on the edge devices. {MPSoCs} are widely used in edge devices due to their capability to execute multiple applications in single-chips. To achieve the targeted security level against physical adversaries, all communications between the {MPSoC} and its environment must be protected. In an {MPSoC} multiple processing elements such as {CPUs} send requests to different on-chip memories. Network-on-chip has been proposed for {MPSoC} design, aiming at increasing performance and reducing power compared to on-chip buses. Tailoring the {NoC} to application(s) takes place usually at design-time. The selection of {NoC} parameter values affects both performance and power, while configuring them unwisely can result in unnecessary area overhead and chip cost. In the present work we concentrate on a commercial interconnect called {STNoC} from {STMicroelectronics}. We keep the {NoC} parameters fixed, and we explore the effects from the variation of other parameters, such as the injection rate of the packets transmitted by the {CPUs}, and the activation/deactivation of a security mechanism integrated in the network interface of the {NoC}, for multiple traffic scenarios with each one representing different amount of legal and malicious requests, for different mappings, and for different node setups. Experimental results, reveal the conditions under which the {NoC} starts experiencing saturation phenomena.},

With {ICs} reaching upwards of billions of transistors, detecting hardware trojans ({HT}) is like finding a needle in a haystack. Therefore, it becomes imperative to protect critical computing infrastructure from malicious attackers attempting to unearth vital information. Security enhancements should offer resiliency to limit their impact on overall chip performance as {HTs} are likely to slip through detection mechanisms. In this paper, we propose packet-security (P-Sec) a packet validation technique to protect compromised network-on-chip ({NoC}) architectures from fault injection side channel attacks and covert {HT} communication by merging two robust error detection schemes, namely algebraic manipulation detection ({AMD}) and cyclic redundancy check ({CRC}) codes. With P-Sec, applications containing sensitive and encrypted data can be protected from an ideal attacker using {AMD} codes at the cost of marginal area and power overhead in the network interface but with enhanced security on demand.},

To overcome the vulnerability to state removal attack and minimize the design overhead, the watermark bits are seamlessly interwoven into the outputs of the existing and free transitions of state transition graph ({STG}). Unlike other transition-based {STG} watermarking, pseudo input variables have been reduced and made functionally indiscernible by the notion of reserved free literal. The assignment of reserved literals is exploited to minimize the overhead of watermarking and make the watermarked {FSM} fallible upon removal of any pseudo input variable. A direct and convenient detection scheme is also proposed to allow the watermark on the {FSM} to be publicly detectable. Experimental results on the watermarked circuits from the {ISCAS}'89 and {IWLS}'93 benchmark sets show lower or acceptably low overheads with higher tamper resilience and stronger authorship proof in comparison with related watermarking schemes for sequential functions.},

Software attacks exploit vulnerabilities in the software on {MPSoCs}. In this paper we propose two {MPSoC} architectural frameworks, {tCUFFS} and {iCUFFS}, for an Application Specific Instruction set Processor ({ASIP}) design. Both {tCUFFS} and {iCUFFS} employ a dedicated security processor for detecting software attacks. {iCUFFS} relies on the exact number of instructions in the basic block to determine an attack and {tCUFFS} relies on time-frame based measures. In addition to software attacks, reliability concerns of bit flip errors in the control flow instructions ({CFIs}) are also addressed. Additional method is proposed to the {iCUFFS} framework to ensure reliable inter-processor communication. The results for the implementation on Xtensa processor from Tensilica showed, worst case runtime penalty of 38\% for {tCUFFS} and 44\% for {iCUFFS}, and worst case area overhead of 33\% for {tCUFFS} and 40\% for {iCUFFS}. The existing {iCUFFS} framework was able to detect approximately 70\% of bit flip errors in the {CFIs}. The modified {iCUFFS} framework proposed for reliable inter-processor communication was at most 4\% slower than the existing {iCUFFS} framework.},

On the other hand, modular and scalable design of {NoCs} enables their enhancements in various directions for supporting services other than simple data routing. In this work we propose and implement a solution to secure attached processing units from a buffer overflow type of the attacks that comes in a form of a protection module that is embedded into the Network Interface of the {NoC}.

Most of the current {MPSoCs} security services are based on symmetric and public-key cryptographic mechanisms. So that, {MPSoCs} integrate a large set of keys that must be exchanged in an efficient and secure way. In such scenario, any security concept will be ineffective if the key management is weak. In this paper, we present the implementation of an on-chip hybrid communication ({HoCs}) security-based architecture, that combines bus and Network-on-chip ({NoC}), to address the efficient and secure key management at {MPSoCs}. The {HoC} implements dynamically the {QoSS} (Quality of Security Service) concept that allows the customization of security. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach over several {MPSoCs} attack scenarios and estimate their impact on the overall performance. We show that our architecture can perform a fast detection of a wide range of attacks and a fast configuration of the different security policies for several {MPSoC} applications. Our hybrid approach saves upto 16\% and 25\% of communication latency and power consumption, respectively, when compared to the {NoC}-based architecture without any security.},

State transition diagrams, the graphical representation of penetrations, identify precisely the requirements for and the compromise of a penetration and present only the critical events that must occur for the successful completion of the penetration. State transition diagrams are written to correspond to the states of an actual computer system, and these diagrams form the basis of a rule based expert system for detecting penetrations, called the state transition analysis tool ({STAT}). The design and implementation of a Unix specific prototype of this expert system, called {USTAT}, is also presented. This prototype provides a further illustration of the overall design and functionality of this intrusion detection approach.

Along with normal requests, malevolent ones, generated by malicious processes running in one or more {CPUs}, could occur. A protection mechanism is therefore required to prevent injection of malicious instructions or data across the system. We propose a self-contained Network-on-Chip ({NoC}) firewall at the network interface ({NI}) layer which, by checking the physical address against a set of rules, rejects untrusted {CPU} requests to the on-chip memory, thus protecting all legitimate processes running in a multicore {SoC}. To sustain high performance, we implement the firewall in hardware, with rule-checking performed at segment-level based on deny rules. Furthermore, to evaluate its impact, we develop a novel framework on top of gem5 simulation environment, coupling {ARM} technology and an instance of a commercial point-to-point interconnect from {STMicroelectronics} ({STNoC}). Simulation tests include scenarios in which legitimate and malicious processes, running in different {CPUs}, request access to shared memory. Our results indicate that a firewall implementation at the {NI} can have a positive effect on network performance by reducing both end-to-end network delay and power consumption. We also show that our coarse-grain firewall can prevent saturation of the on-chip network and performs better than fine-grain alternatives that perform rule checking at page-level. Simulation results are accompanied with field measurements performed on a Zedboard platform running Linux, whereas the {NoC} Firewall is implemented as a reconfigurable, memory-mapped device on top of {AMBA} {AXI}4 interconnect fabric.},

Efficiency on both software and hardware platforms is a remarkable characteristic of Camellia in addition to its high level of security. It is confirmed that Camellia provides strong security against differential and linear cryptanalyses. Compared to the {AES} finalists, i.e., {MARS}, {RC}6, Rijndael, Serpent, and Twofish, Camellia offers at least comparable encryption speed in software and hardware. An optimized implementation of Camellia in assembly language can encrypt on a Pentium {III} (800MHz) at the rate of more than 276 Mbits per second, which is much faster than the speed of an optimized {DES} implementation. In addition, a distinguishing feature is its small hardware design. The hardware design, which includes encryption and decryption and key schedule, occupies approximately 11K gates, which is the smallest among all existing 128-bit block ciphers as far as we know.},

	abstract = {Providing security in an embedded system often boils down to solving a trade-off problem between security and performance. Simultaneously, Multi-Processor System-on-a-Chip ({MPSoC}) devices are in the early stages to increase computational performance, energy and die area efficiency, and reduce the number of physical units in the embedded system design arena. Moreover, {MPSoCs} enable composing heterogeneous subsystems on a single silicon die which is particularly desirable for large volume embedded devices. However, these benefits come at a price: an increase in the system's complexity. Complexity does not only make the system design process more difficult, but also it renders certain vulnerabilities possible. A solution is to follow well-established architectural principles to reduce complexity and to provide the required level of security. In this paper we demonstrate how the basic architectural principles of the {ACROSS} {MPSoC} architecture can be combined with the requirements of standard security techniques (i.e., encryption, authentication) to produce an efficient security solution for {MPSoC} systems. We propose a security architecture which uses the principles of temporal and spatial partitioning, temporal determinism, and mixed-criticality integration to migrate resource expensive security functions form the application components to a dedicated security component within the {MPSoC}. This leaves application components with a thin security provider, without any loss of functionality and more local resources at their disposal. Thereby, we deliver a flexible, resource efficient security solution, which highlights the benefits of partitioning {MPSoC} architectures for security.},

A new static shortest path algorithm is presented and its performance compared with the standard shortest path algorithm, using two new metrics. We propose the use of this routing algorithm in network simulators instead of standard Dijkstra, as it produces more symmetric and balanced routes over the network links, thus producing results that are closer to real networks which implement a more dynamic routing.},

industry ({MPSoC}) and the massive advances presented by all
things interconnected (Internet of Things), a massive quantity of private and metadata is being transferred through insecure channels. In the industry, almost no attention is given to the amount of data that can be collected from different individuals, just by getting access to their house appliances. With that in mind, this paper proposes a non-intrusive and reconfigurable access control architecture for Networks-on-Chip ({NoCs}). This architecture comprises firewalls, which are capable of filtering both incoming and outgoing network traffic by analyzing packet
information and verifying a traffic initiator’s access permission, providing a secure environment that is capable of protecting the user data. The firewalls have approximately 12\% of the router area. When the number of routers increases, the firewall area overhead grows slightly, up to only 16\% in {NoCs} with 64 routers.},

These algorithms are not only deadlock free and livelock free, but can also leverage non-minimal routing paths to avoid traffic congestion and improve fault tolerance. Moreover, these algorithms are backward compatible with existing minimal routing schemes. As a result, they represent an ideal routing solution to {NoC}-based interconnections designed for both existing and emerging embedded multicore systems.},

A network on chip draws on concepts inherited from distributed systems and computer networks subject areas to interconnect {IP} cores in a structured and scalable way. The main goal pursued is to achieve superior bandwidth when compared to conventional on-chip bus architectures. This paper reviews the state of the art in networks on chip. Then, it describes an infrastructure called Hermes, targeted to implement packet-switching mesh and related interconnection architectures and topologies. The basic element of Hermes is a switch with five bi-directional ports, connecting to four other switches and to a local {IP} core. The switch employs an {XY} routing algorithm, and uses input queuing. The main design objective was to develop a small size switch, enabling its immediate practical use. The paper also presents the design validation of the Hermes switch and of a network on chip based on it. A Hermes {NoC} case study has been successfully prototyped in hardware as described in the paper, demonstrating the functionality of the approach. Quantitative data for the Hermes infrastructure is advanced.},

	abstract = {The design of scalable and reliable interconnection networks for system on chips ({SoCs}) introduce new design constraints not present in current multicomputer systems. Although regular topologies are preferred for building {NoCs}, heterogeneous blocks, fabrication faults and reliability issues derived from the high integration scale may lead to irregular topologies. In this situation, efficient routing becomes a challenge. Although table-based routing allows the use of most routing algorithms on any topology, it does not scale in terms of latency and area. In this paper we propose the region-based routing mechanism that avoids the scalability problems of table-based solutions. From an initial topology and routing algorithm, the mechanism groups, at every switch, destinations into different regions based on the output ports. By doing this, redundant routing information typically found in routing tables is eliminated. Evaluation results show that the mechanism requires only four regions to support several routing algorithms in a 2D mesh with no performance degradation. Moreover, when dealing with link failures, our results indicate that the mechanism combined with the segment-based routing algorithm is able to pack all the routing information into eight regions providing high throughput. The paper provides also a simple and efficient hardware implementation of the mechanism requiring only 240 logic gates per switch to support eight regions in a 2D mesh topology},

The proposed architecture works as a firewall managing the memory accesses on the basis of a lookup table containing the access rights. This module, called Data Protection Unit ({DPU}), has been designed for {MPSoC} architectures and integrated in the Network Interfaces near the shared memory. We implement the {DPU} inside an {MPSoC} architecture on {FPGA} and we add features to the module to be aware of dynamic reconfiguration of the system software. Starting from a general overview of our design down to components' structure, we introduce the place and the role of the {DPU} module inside the system for a reconfigurable secure implementation of a {MPSoC} on {FPGA}. The description of the {DPU} concept, its implementation, and integration into the system are described in detail.

Routing methods have a prominent role in taking advantage of the potential benefits offered by {NoCs}. As a result, designing high-performance and efficient routing algorithms is highly desirable. In this paper, the Hamiltonian-based Odd–Even ({HOE}) turn model is proposed for both unicast and multicast routing in wormhole-switched 2D mesh networks. {HOE} is able to maximize the degree of adaptiveness by minimizing the number of prohibited turns, such that the algorithm remains deadlock-free without adding virtual channels. By increasing the number of alternative minimal paths, the hotspots are less likely to be created and the traffic is efficiently distributed throughout the network. The simulation results in terms of latency and power consumption indicate the better performance of the proposed method in comparison with the existing routing methods.},

A system on chip ({SoC}) can provide an integrated solution to challenging design problems in the telecommunications, multimedia, and consumer electronics domains. Much of the progress in these fields hinges on the designers' ability to conceive complex electronic engines under strong time-to-market pressure. Success will require using appropriate design and process technologies, as well as interconnecting existing components reliably in a plug-and-play fashion. Focusing on using probabilistic metrics such as average values or variance to quantify design objectives such as performance and power will lead to a major change in {SoC} design methodologies. Overall, these designs will be based on both deterministic and stochastic models. Creating complex {SoCs} requires a modular, component-based approach to both hardware and software design. Despite numerous challenges, the authors believe that developers will solve the problems of designing {SoC} networks. At the same time, they believe that a layered micronetwork design methodology will likely be the only path to mastering the complexity of future {SoC} designs},

These technologies are very close to physical limitations increasing faults in manufacture and at runtime. Thus, it is essential to provide a fault recovery mechanism for {NoC} operation in the presence of faults. The preprocessing of the most probable fault scenarios and flits retransmission capability enable to anticipate the calculation of deadlock-free routings, reducing the time necessary to interrupt the system in a fault occurrence and maintaining links operating with retransmission capability. This work proposes a smart decisions mechanism for errors on {NoC} links, which is composed of a hardware part implemented into the links and routers, and a software part implemented inside an operating system kernel of each processor. The mechanism defines thresholds where is better to reconfigure the {NoC} or to retransmit flits with errors. Experimental results, with several {NoC} sizes and some error models, suggest when is better to reconfigure the {NoC} and when is better to maintain some links operating with eventual faults.},

We observe that a wide range of common security attacks are manifested as abnormalities in the system-level communication traffic. Therefore, the communication architecture, with its global system-level visibility, can be used to detect them. The communication architecture can also effectively react to security attacks by disallowing the offending communication transactions, or by notifying appropriate components of a security violation. We describe the general principles involved in a security-enhanced communication architecture ({SECA}) and show how several security objectives can be encoded in terms of policies that govern the inter-component communication traffic. We detail the implementation of {SECA} in the context of a popular commercial on-chip bus architecture (the {AMBA} architecture from {ARM}) through a combination of a centralized security enforcement module, and enhancements to the bus interfaces of system components. We illustrate how {SECA} can be used to enhance embedded system security in several application scenarios. A simple instance of {SECA} has been implemented in a commercial application processor {SoC} for mobile phones. We provide results of experiments performed to validate the proposed concepts through system-level simulation, and evaluate their overheads through hardware implementation using a commercial design flow.},

Some academic and industrial frameworks are available to support bus-based {MPSoCs}, but few works target {NoCs} as underlying communication architecture. A framework targeting {MPSoC} customization must provide abstract models to enable fast design space exploration, flexible application mapping strategies, all coupled to features to evaluate the performance of running applications. This paper proposes a framework to customize {NoC}-based {MPSoCs} with support to static and dynamic task mapping and C/{SystemC} simulation models for processors and memories. A simple, specifically designed microkernel executes in each processor, enabling multitasking at the processor level. Graphical tools enable debug and system verification, individualizing data for each task. Practical results highlight the benefit of using dynamic mapping strategies (total execution time reduction) and abstract models (total simulation time reduction without losing accuracy).},

In this paper, we analyze different routing schemes for packetized on-chip communication on a mesh network architecture, with particular emphasis on specific benefits and limitations of silicon {VLSI} implementations. A contention-look-ahead on-chip routing scheme is proposed. It reduces the network delay with significantly smaller buffer requirement. We further show that in the on-chip multiprocessor systems, both the instruction execution inside node processors, as well as data transaction between different processing elements, are greatly affected by the packetized dataflows that are transported on the on-chip networks. Different packetization schemes affect the performance and power consumption of multiprocessor systems.

	abstract = {An efficient routing algorithm is important for large on-chip networks [network-on-chip ({NoC})] to provide the required communication performance to applications. Implementing {NoC} using table-based switches provide many advantages, including possibility of changing routing algorithms and fault tolerance, due to the option of table reconfigurations. However, table-based switches have been considered unsuitable for {NoCs} due to their perceived high area and power consumption. In this paper, we describe the region-based routing ({RBR}) mechanism which groups destinations into network regions allowing an efficient implementation with logic blocks. {RBR} can also be viewed as a mechanism to reduce the number of entries in routing tables. {RBR} is general and can be used in conjunction with any adaptive routing algorithm. In particular, we have evaluated the proposed scheme in conjunction with a general routing algorithm, namely segment-based routing ({SR}) and an application specific routing algorithm ({APSRA}) using regular and irregular mesh topologies. Our study shows that the number of entries in the table is significantly reduced, especially for large networks. Evaluation results show that {RBR} requires only four regions to support several routing algorithms in a 2-D mesh with no performance degradation. Considering link failures, our results indicate that {RBR} combined with {SR} is able to tolerate up to 7 link failures in an 8times8 mesh. {RBR} also reduces area and power dissipation of an equivalent table-based implementation by factors of 8 and 10, respectively. Moreover, the degradation in performance of the network is insignificant when using {APSRA} combined with {RBR}.},

	abstract = {Computers get faster every year, but the demand for computing resources seems to grow at an even faster rate. Depending on the problem domain, this demand for more power can be satisfied by either, massively parallel computers, or clusters of computers. Common for both approaches is the dependence on high performance interconnect networks such as Myrinet, Infiniband, or 10 Gigabit Ethernet. While high throughput and low latency are key features of interconnection networks, the issue of fault-tolerance is now becoming increasingly important. As the number of network components grows so does the probability for failure, thus it becomes important to also consider the fault-tolerance mechanism of interconnection networks. The main challenge then lies in combining performance and fault-tolerance, while still keeping cost and complexity low. This paper proposes a new deterministic routing methodology for tori and meshes, which achieves high performance without the use of virtual channels. Furthermore, it is topology agnostic in nature, meaning it can handle any topology derived from any combination of faults when combined with static reconfiguration. The algorithm, referred to as segment-based routing ({SR}), works by partitioning a topology into subnets, and subnets into segments. This allows us to place bidirectional turn restrictions locally within a segment. As segments are independent, we gain the freedom to place turn restrictions within a segment independently from other segments. This results in a larger degree of freedom when placing turn restrictions compared to other routing strategies. In this paper a way to compute segment-based routing tables is presented and applied to meshes and tori. Evaluation results show that {SR} increases performance by a factor of 1.8 over {FX} and up*/down* routing},

A network on chip draws on concepts inherited from distributed systems and computer networks subject areas to interconnect {IP} cores in a structured and scalable way. The main goal pursued is to achieve superior bandwidth when compared to conventional on-chip bus architectures. This paper reviews the state of the art in networks on chip. Then, it describes an infrastructure called Hermes, targeted to implement packet-switching mesh and related interconnection architectures and topologies. The basic element of Hermes is a switch with five bi-directional ports, connecting to four other switches and to a local {IP} core. The switch employs an {XY} routing algorithm, and uses input queuing. The main design objective was to develop a small size switch, enabling its immediate practical use. The paper also presents the design validation of the Hermes switch and of a network on chip based on it. A Hermes {NoC} case study has been successfully prototyped in hardware as described in the paper, demonstrating the functionality of the approach. Quantitative data for the Hermes infrastructure is advanced.},

In this work, we propose a 3D-{NoC} hardware architecture able to protect the 3D-{MPSoCs} against software attacks. Dynamic firewalls create elastic security zones by wrapping a set of components according to a trust policy, guaranteeing the protection and efficient execution of all applications.

By carefully scheduling the network into waves that flow across the interconnect, data from different domains carried by these waves are strictly noninterfering while avoiding the significant overheads associated with cycle-by-cycle time multiplexing. The authors describe the scheduling policy and router microarchitecture changes required, and evaluate the information-flow security of a synthesizable implementation through gate-level information flow analysis. When comparing their approach for varying numbers of domains and network sizes, they find that in many cases {SurfNoC} can reduce the latency overhead of implementing cycle-level noninterference by up to 85 percent.},

It's designed by following the overall architecture of Crypton but with redesign and simplification of each component function to enable much compact implementation in both hardware and software. A simple hardware implementation of {mCrypton} is also presented to demonstrate its suitability to our target applications. Our prototype implementation based on the straightforward 1 cycle/round architecture just requires about 3500 to 4100 gates for both encryption and decryption, and about 2400 to 3000 gates for encryption only (under 0.13μm {CMOS} technology). The result shows that the hardware complexity of {mCrypton} is quite well within an economic range of low-cost {RFID} tags and sensors. A more compact implementation under development promises that further size reduction around 30\% could be achievable using the 5 cycles/round architecture.},

	title = {Security Effectiveness and a Hardware Firewall for {MPSoCs}},
	doi = {10.1109/HPCC.2014.173},
	abstract = {There is a constant increase in the interest shown for trusted computing in the embedded domain. In an {MPSoC} each processing element such as a {CPU} could request accessing any physical resource of the device such as a memory or an I/O component. Along with normal requests, malevolent ones could occur produced by malware applications or processes running in one or more {CPUs}. A protection mechanism is required to prevent injection of malicious data across the device, e.g. Unsafe data written by a {CPU} into a memory address, which are read later by another {CPU}. A considerable amount of research has been devoted in security for {MPSoCs}, but limited work exists in performing protection at the source instead of the target, thus cutting-off malicious content at an early stage prior to entering the on-chip network. In the present work we focus on the side of the {CPU} connected to the {SoC} network. We are envisioning a self-contained {NoC} firewall, which by checking the physical address of a request to a memory-mapped device against a set of rules, rejects untrusted {CPU} requests to the on-chip memory, thus protecting all legitimate applications running in a shared-memory {SoC}. To sustain high-performance we implemented the firewall in hardware, while rule-checking is performed at segment-level based on deny rules. To evaluate the impact of security mechanisms we developed a novel framework based on gem5, coupling {ARM} technology and an instance of a commercial point-to-point interconnect from {STMicroelectronics} called Spider on {STNoC}. Tests include several scenarios with legitimate and malicious processes running in different {CPUs} requesting access to shared memory. Preliminary results show that the incorporation of a security mechanism in the network interface can have a positive effect on network performance by reducing both the end-to-end delivery time of packets, and the power consumed from unnecessary transmissions. From the network aspect, this effect is independent of the pe- formance of implementation itself, e.g. Either a hardware or a software solution equally relieves the network from unnecessary loads. Finally, we compare the performance of our hardware approach over a simple equivalent software solution. Certainly, this comparison favours hardware by considerable margins, however we use it only as reference to illustrate the merit from implementing protection in hardware. The purpose of the present study is three-fold. First, we present the proposed hardware {NoC} firewall. Then we examine the effect on network transmissions from incorporating a security mechanism in the network interface, to do this we developed a novel framework. Finally, we include preliminary performance results of our {NoC} firewall and a simple yet indicative comparison with a software solution.},
