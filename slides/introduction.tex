	\begin{itemize}
		\setlength{\itemsep}{0.5em}
		\item<1-> The Network-on-Chip (NoC) has been widely adopted as a paradigm capable of providing a reliable and scalable interconnection in MPSoCs \cite{sgroi_addressing_2001}, \cite{ye_packetization_2004}
		
		\item<1-> The concern for data protection appears as a design requirement of MPSoCs
		
		\item<1-> Protection usually occurs at either:
			\begin{itemize}
				\setlength{\itemsep}{0.5em}
				\item<1-> \emph{Application Level}, e.g.,\ using data encryption or source authentication; or
				\item<1-> \emph{Communication Level}, e.g.,\ detecting abnormal communication behavior in the system.
			\end{itemize}
		
		\item<1-> NoCs have been shown to aid in the overall MPSoC protection \cite{diguet_noc-centric_2007}, \cite{sepulveda_noc-based_2015}, \cite{grammatikakis_security_2014}, by implementing security services at communication level

\begin{frame}{Objectives}
	\begin{itemize}
		\setlength{\itemsep}{1em}
		\item<1-> The definition of a routing model that is capable of considering system security requirements to define safe routing paths
		
		\item<1-> The creation of an abstract model that enables the implementation and the verification of the routing technique
		
		\item<1-> The validation and evaluation of the routing algorithm for different security configurations
		
		\item<1-> The adaptation of an existing NoC simulation platform to employ this new routing model for behavior evaluation
